# Mortgage Probability of Default Analysis Using Random Forest and Sampling Techniques

## Assignment Overview
This project involves building a **Random Forest (RF) model** to predict the probability of mortgage defaults. The analysis includes experimenting with at least two sampling techniques (under-sampling and over-sampling) to address class imbalance in the dataset. Performance metrics such as **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)** and **Cumulative Lift** are used to evaluate and compare the model results.

## Dataset Description
- **Domain**: Mortgage default prediction.
- **Key Features**:
  - Mortgage-specific attributes such as credit scores, loan amounts, and payment history.
  - Predictor variables encoded from categorical features for model compatibility.
  - Highly imbalanced target variable: `default` (binary classification of mortgage default cases).

## Objectives
1. **Random Forest Model**:
   - Build a robust Random Forest model using hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluate model performance using ROC and Cumulative Lift metrics.
2. **Sampling Techniques**:
   - Apply **Over-Sampling** (e.g., SMOTE or Random Over-Sampling) to increase the representation of the minority class.
   - Apply **Under-Sampling** to balance the dataset by reducing the majority class samples.
   - Compare the effectiveness of the sampling techniques in improving model performance.
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Experiment with variable selection/dropping to enhance model predictability.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Test a range of hyperparameters to optimize the Random Forest model.
   - Present the final hyperparameters that deliver the best outcome.
