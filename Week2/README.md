# Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering Assignment

## Description

This project focuses on conducting an exhaustive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating meaningful features for an unsupervised machine learning model. The dataset provided lacks a target variable, necessitating the creation of features that capture meaningful insights and can help identify anomalies.

## Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Perform detailed EDA with structured sections based on different leads.
   - Visualize data insights while maintaining clarity and organization.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create at least 15 unique features.
   - Ensure features provide high information content and align with anomaly detection requirements.
   - Justify each feature with an explanation of its potential to identify anomalies.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Write clear, concise markdown explanations for each step of the analysis.
   - Provide sufficient code comments for clarity and reproducibility.
   - Treat the Jupyter Notebook as a polished article with attention to aesthetics.

## Methods and Tools

- **Tools Used:**
  - Python for data analysis and feature engineering.
  - Jupyter Notebook for creating a structured report with code and markdown.
  - Visualization libraries such as `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for insightful graphs.

- **Techniques:**
  - Exploratory analysis of key dataset attributes.
  - Custom feature creation based on domain understanding.
  - Visualization of feature distributions and relationships.

## Features Created

- **Highlights:**
  - A total of 15 unique features, ensuring diversity and relevance.
  - Examples include ratio-based metrics, categorical aggregations, and normalized measures.
  - Each feature includes a detailed justification for its use in anomaly detection.

- **Insights:**
  - Features revealed patterns and trends in the data, aiding anomaly detection.
  - Effective use of ratios and aggregations provided deeper insights into the data.

## Deliverables

- **Final Submission:** An HTML file containing the Jupyter Notebook report.
- **Content:** Includes EDA, feature creation, visualizations, and a summary of insights.

## Conclusion

The assignment demonstrated the critical role of feature engineering in unsupervised machine learning. High-quality features significantly contribute to model success by capturing valuable insights and patterns. This project emphasized thoughtful data exploration and robust feature creation to address the challenges posed by the absence of a target variable.
